I want to write today about how I start my day on the right track. I know a lot is said about discipline on how you need to wake up and zone in on what's the most important thing and get that completed. For me, I wake up and listen to what my body need. Am I in pain? Am I sick? Am I thirsty? Am I sad? I wake up and listen to the body and take care of it's need. If I do that immediately, I usually find myself in a clearer state of mind to make wise decisions to start the day off correctly. A good example of that is me waking up one morning and my left arm felt numb from exercising the night before. Instead of waking up and going through my usual routine, I started massaging my arm, trying to find where the pain is, and then adding ointment. I find that my mind isn't thinking too much about the pain because I tended to it. I'm sure we can go on and on about some good ways to start the day off, but for this blog, I would like to focus on zoning in on the bodies need because that's what fuels us throughout the day.

In this article, I learned that it takes a lot of practice to learn how to properly listen to your body. I think a good example that was shared on here was the saying, "...we have an idea of what we should be experiencing regardless it if has something to do with what we actually are experiencing." I think the body can be a little or a lot tricky to listen to. A lot of the time we have an agenda we have to meet, or things that we would like to get done, and we sway our mind to not listen to the body too much because it probably will get in the way of you getting things done even though you should probably take a break.
