## How I Start My Day on the Right Track

I want to write today about how I start my day on the right track. I know a lot is said about discipline, how you need to wake up, zone in on what's most important, and get that completed. For me, however, I wake up and listen to what my body needs. Am I in pain? Am I sick? Am I thirsty? Am I sad? I wake up, listen to my body, and take care of its needs. If I do that immediately, I usually find myself in a clearer state of mind to make wise decisions and start the day off correctly,

A good example of that is me waking up one morning when my left arm felt numb from exercising the night before. Instead of waking up and going through my usual routine, I started massaging my arm, trying to find where the pain was, and then adding ointment. I find that my mind isn't thinking too much about the pain because I attended to it. I'm sure we could go on and on about some good ways to start the day off, but for this blog, I would like to focus on tuning into the body's needs because that's what fuels us throughout the day.

## Why Listening to Your Body Takes Practice

In this article, "Why and How to Listen to Your Body" from Complicated.life, I learned that it takes a lot of practice to learn how to properly listen to your body.

Source: "Why and How to Listen to Your Body" (Complicated.life, n.d.).

I think a good example that was shared on there was the saying, "...we have an idea of what we should be experiencing regardless of if it has something to do with what we actually are experiencing." I think the body can be a little or a lot tricky to listen to. A lot of the time we have an agenda we have to meet, or things that we would like to get done, and we persuade our mind to not listen to the body too much because it probably will get in the way of getting things done even though you should probably take a break.
