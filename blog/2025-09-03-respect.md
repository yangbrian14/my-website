Respect. One of the thing that everyone feels they are entitled to. As a father, son, and a husband, isn't that something that should be put on our name by our children's and spouse. What would someone have to do to be put in a place where they are not respected. After being let go of my job, I feel a deep sense of disrespect from my wife. I'm being reminded everyday how much a burden I am. Sometimes I'm now sure what more I can do to prove my worth. Am I not enough?
