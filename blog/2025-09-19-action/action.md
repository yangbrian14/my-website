"Pow, pow, pow!" That was the noise I made playing with action figures as a kid. In this blog, I'll attempt to write a short-story action fight scene between two gladiators.

The champ walks in with heavy, vicious footsteps. With every step, you can see the sand lift off his sandals. His golden breastplate shines in the beaming sun as he steps from the shadow onto the arena. He pauses, gazes at the crowd with confidence, and then he yells his name, "Orooculus!" He continues, "I'll dismantle and behead any challenger who dares to face me!" He pounds his spear heavily onto his large rectangular shield while chanting, "Ahoo, Ahoo, Ahoo!"

Slowly, a challenger steps out from the shadow onto the arena, standing exactly where the sun and the shadow meet. Orooculus yells across the arena, "State your name, soldier!" The challenger, holding his helm at the side of his hip, slowly gazes around the stadium, looking left to right, and then stares into Orooculus's soul. With a calm, but loud voice, he says, "Maximillian Atrocies. I'm a father, a husband, and a son. I serve no man; I fight for myself now, and I fight for freedom." Orooculus laughed scoffingly and then replies with cold rage, "Freedom you shall have... death!"

Maximillian puts on his silver helm, his plain silver breastplate and shin armor glittering in the sun. Immediately, Maximillian sets his eyes on Orooculus, dashes forward, and starts sprinting with both of his swords swinging from side to side. Orooculus sees how quick he is, and quickly states, "He's fast. I need to close in on him, or he'll strike first." Orooculus lifts up his spear over his head and hurls it as quick and precise as he can. Maximillian, closing the distance quickly, was already so close that the spear flew past him. Maximillian, with one stomp from the ground, glides into the air with both of his swords in the air above his head, and comes flying down, slashing heavily at Orooculus's shield.
