Officially my first blog and I wanted to just say that I was let go of my job about 2 weeks ago. Still very surreal for me because I liked what I did. It's also my first professional corporate job. You know, one of those tech company you were seriously interested about, applied, and prayed for. You got it, and now you don't got it. Anyways, here I am, no job. Came home to my wife and kids and felt like the weight of work left my shoulder and I can finally breath freely. NOPE, the weight is heavier now.

I recently just scrolled through Instagram and came across a video where a man was asked "what's the most delusional thing you've ever told yourself?" He answered saying "Everythings gonna be alright." Yeah, so true. It's not going to be alright. I have a family to support. Okay, so what's the first thing I'm going to do? I can't just sit here and feel bad about myself while the wifey is slaying away keeping everyone on their feet. Well, I played to my strength. I got a gym membership, and I started to work on my portolio website, and I started a blog.

You see, a lot of the time we tend to look at ourselves and say, "what am I lacking?" It might not be anything you are lacking or missing? Maybe we're just spreading ourselves too thin. Put all of our energy to those things that we actually care about, like our strengths, and put in 120% effort into it. If I'm an english teacher, I'm not going to be spending my time worrying too much about numbers, even if it's a part of my job. I'll just get through it, and then tunnel vision into what I actually like doing. So, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Love my wife, play and teach my kids, and write. 

Another cool thing I would like to add to my life is actually applying all of my saved motivational video from social media. I think if I can apply a fraction of it to my daily life, and share it with you here on how I'm doing, it might help some of us to actually learn from what we are scrolling through. Some of those video hit so hard and so real, you can't just let it slip by like that. It's time to start using it.
