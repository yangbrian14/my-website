# Covenant Path Progress

The [**Covenant Path Progress**](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/tools/help/covenant-path-progress-report?lang=eng) is a tracking tool used by leaders to monitor new and returning members, and people being taught by missionaries. It’s a report available through the [**Member Tools App**](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/tools/help/about-member-tools?lang=eng). 

Here’s a quick step-by-step guide focusing on the **Being Taught** list inside the **Covenant Path Progress** so leaders can coordinate fellowshipping effectively. This example is on the mobile app. 

1. Open **Member Tools → Covenant Path Progress →** click on **Being Taught**.

2. Read the **Being Taught** list  
   * You’ll see people the missionaries are currently teaching. This list is synced from the missionaries’ Area Book.  
        
3. Tap a **Name** to review details (sacrament attendant, baptismal date, next scheduled event, friends in the church, etc.). 

## Use Case in Ward Council / Missionary Coordination

For each person, answer these five on the spot (and record in the app as appropriate):

1. **Friendship**: Who is the primary fellowshipping friend? (Name one.)

2. **Next invitation**: What’s the next step (church this Sunday, activity, lesson with member present)?

3. **Logistics**: Who’s inviting/bringing them (and when)?

4. **Needs from ward**: Priesthood blessing? Rides? Nursery help?

5. **Baptismal path**: Are commitments and dates clear? (Missionaries update dates; leaders ensure support.)
