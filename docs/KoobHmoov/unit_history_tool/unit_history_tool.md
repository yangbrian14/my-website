# How to create a story using the Unit History tool

The Unit History tool allows leaders to write and review stories, which are then visible online to members of the same ward or stake. These stories are saved and archived automatically. Submitting these histories fulfills the Lord's charge to record important events of the church and stewardship. The following step below will help you create a story.

1. Click on this [Link](https://unithistory.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng) and login by using your lds.org username and password.
